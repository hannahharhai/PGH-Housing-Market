# PGH-Housing-Market
This project was conducted to determine how or if external factors affect the Pittsburgh housing market. We analyzed data from the past 20 years to find if correlations exist between housing prices and other factors, such as income, unemployment rates, and poverty levels. We also touch on other external factors that could play a role in the housing market including recessions and the COVID-19 virus. 

The main tools we used in this project consist of RStudio and its various libraries. Within RStudio we utilized libraries for data importing, data manipulation, and data display. More specifically, we used R’s statistical and various graphing packages.

In the end unemployment and poverty rates did not have much of a relationship with the housing market at all. However, per capita income and average housing prices have continually increased over the past two decades so it’s no surprise that they have a strong correlation.
