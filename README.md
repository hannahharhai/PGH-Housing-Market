# PGH-Housing-Market
This project was conducted to determine how or if external factors affect the Pittsburgh housing market. We analyed data from the past 20 years to find if correlations exist between housing prices and other factors, such as income, unemployment rates, and poverty levels.

The main tools we used in this project consist of RStudio and its various libraries. Within RStudio we utilized libraries for data importing, data manipulation, and data display. More specifically, we used Râ€™s statistical and various graphing packages.
